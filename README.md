This is the base repository for Medivia Analyzer. This is a tool that analyzes character data collected by the mediviastats.info API and shows the user useful information about the character name that was searched. This includes special accesses that are granted to a character inside Medivia through tasks and quests. The user can also see special flags that are dynamically assigned to each character profile based on their frags, experience gained as well as other types of information. This tool was built using React JS and frameworks like Material-UI and Chart JS.

You can access the deployed version of this app at: [Medivia Analyzer](https://medivia-analyzer.herokuapp.com)
